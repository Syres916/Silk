Silk is the new name of the [NURBSlib_EVM](http://edwardvmills.github.io/NURBSlib_EVM/) project.

Until documentation and tutorials are rewritten for Silk, [NURBSlib_EVM](http://edwardvmills.github.io/NURBSlib_EVM/) is the best source of information regarding the project. 
The tutorials can still be followed, simply skip the setup portion, and the instructions related to color and display mode of the objects.
